Description: An R implementation of the Fortran River Quality Planning tools. It
    allows you to generate mass balance based estimates of water quality
    downstream of a single discharge. Downstream water quality estimates can be
    generated using summary statistics or by entering observed data. The R 
    implementation should be considered more flexible than the Fortran GUI
    versions, calibrated can be edited, distributions can be specified and
    multiple 'RQPs' can be easily be chained.
