#' @title R Implementation of EA River Quality Planning Tools
#'
#' @description An R implementation of the Fortran River Quality Planning tools. It
#' allows you to generate mass balance based estimates of water quality
#' downstream of a single discharge. Downstream water quality estimates can be
#' generated using summary statistics or by entering observed data. The R
#' implementation should be considered more flexible than the Fortran GUI
#' versions, calibrated can be edited, distributions can be specified and
#' multiple 'RQPs' can be easily be chained.
